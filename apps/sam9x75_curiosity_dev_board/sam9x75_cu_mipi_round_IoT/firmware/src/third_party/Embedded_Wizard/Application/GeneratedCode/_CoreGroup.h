/* The class Core::Group provides the base functionality for all kinds of complex 
   GUI components, like the push button, the slider or the entire menu panel. All 
   user defined GUI components do descend from this class.
   Groups serve as containers for other views. They are able to manage any number 
   of enclosed views, to arrange these views, to redraw them automatically and to 
   deliver user input events to the views. They act as the unique @Owner of the 
   enclosed views. At the same time the groups borderline determines the area where 
   its views can appear. Parts of views lying outside this @Bounds area are per 
   default clipped and not visible.
   Each group defines its own coordinate system starting with the origin <0,0> at 
   the top-left corner of the group. All views enclosed within the group are placed 
   relatively to this origin. Moving a group automatically moves the corresponding 
   coordinate system and thus the enclosed views. You don't need to take care about 
   it.
   Since the Core::Group class descends from the very basic ordinary Core::View 
   class, groups can be enclosed within other groups, by what nesting of GUI components 
   is possible. For example, several push button components can be enclosed within 
   a superior menu component in order to design a more complex component. It's up 
   to you to compose these view hierarchies.
   The interface of the Core::Group class provides a wide range of methods and some 
   properties to control the group and the enclosed views. For example:
   - The list of enclosed views is controlled by the methods @Add(), @Remove() and 
   @Restack(). These methods allow you to insert new views to the group, to remove 
   existing views from the group or to change the so-called Z-order of views - the 
   order determining which view lies in the front and which in the background of 
   the group.
   - More sophisticated: with the method @FadeGroup() animated transitions to add 
   and fade-in or to fade-out and remove a GUI component within 'this' component 
   can be scheduled.
   - To find and enumerate the enclosed views, the methods like @FindNextView(), 
   @FindPrevView(), @FindViewAtPosition, @FindViewInDirection(), @FindViewWithStackingPriority() 
   or @GetViewAtIndex() are available. 
   - Although the screen redraw is performed automatically by the framework, the 
   method InvalidateArea() can be used to request an explicit screen update for 
   the given area of the group. Furthermore, by overriding the methods @DrawBackground() 
   and @DrawForeground() the descending class can implement additional code to draw 
   the areas behind and in front of the enclosed views programmatically.
   - If the size of the group changes, all enclosed views are arranged automatically 
   accordingly to their @Layout properties. If more sophisticated arrangement is 
   desired the method @UpdateLayout() can be overridden and filled with the appropriate 
   logic to calculate the position and size of views. If your application case it 
   requires, you can trigger the layout update explicitly by invoking the method 
   @InvalidateLayout().
   - Although the delivery of user input events to the views is performed automatically 
   by the framework, the both methods @DispatchEvent() and @BroadcastEvent() can 
   be used to feed the group and its views with any additional user defined events.
   - The visibility of the group and thus the visibility of all enclosed views is 
   controlled by the properties @Visible, @AlphaBlended, @Opacity and @Embedded. 
   In particular the property @Embedded can determine whether the corresponding 
   GUI component is limited (== embedded) to the boundary of a sibling Core::Outline 
   view or not. The embedding of views within a Core::Outline allows a kind of sub-groups 
   within the group itself. Very useful for any kind of scrollable lists, menus, 
   etc.
   - The property @Buffered controls whether the group should store its aspect in 
   an off-screen bitmap. This feature is useful when e.g. the entire group should 
   be animated - it can avoid superfluous redrawing of the groups content. Other 
   advantage of this feature is the possibility to replicate the aspect of a group 
   within a Views::Group or Views::WarpGroup view. With other words, several copies 
   of the group aspect can be shown on the screen. Useful for many fade-in, 2D/3D 
   warp or mirror visual effects.
   - The property @ClipViews and the method @ExtendClipping() control how views 
   lying outside the boundary area of the component should appear. Extending or 
   disabling the clipping is useful especially in application cases of the component 
   containing some shadows or blur effects.
   - Other useful feature is the centralized and uniform update of the GUI state. 
   Usually every GUI component does store its current state, like the states 'on' 
   or 'off' in case of a toggle switch component. This state can change at the runtime 
   e.g. in response to the user interaction. To handle this state alteration the 
   method @UpdateViewState() can be overridden and filled with the desired logic 
   to reflect the current state in the appearance of the GUI component. In this 
   manner the entire state update is located in a single method. This method will 
   be invoked automatically by the framework. Optionally you can request its invocation 
   by using the method @InvalidateViewState().
   - The class Core::Group implements a powerful infrastructure permitting simple 
   presentation and dismissing of GUI components in context of 'this' component 
   similarly to the concepts of 'alert panels', 'message boxes' or 'dialogs' known 
   from other GUI frameworks. Internally, every instance of Core::Group manages 
   a stack with all dialog components belonging actually to it. The dialog component 
   on top of the stack is considered as the active dialog - the dialog, the user 
   may interact with. Other dialogs lying in the background are automatically deactivated 
   and they are suppressed from being able to receive and process user inputs. New 
   dialogs are presented by using the method @PresentDialog(). With the method @SwitchToDialog() 
   you can replace the actually active dialog by another one. Finally, with the 
   method @DismissDialog() one of the actually presented dialogs can be dismissed 
   again. Every of these operations can be performed with animation transitions, 
   you specify in the parameters when invoking the respective method.
   - If using the above described infrastructure to manage dialogs, you can use 
   the methods @IsDialog(), @IsActiveDialog() and @IsCurrentDialog() to verify whether 
   the affected GUI component is actually, just in this moment a dialog presented 
   within another GUI component, whether it is an active dialog or even the current 
   dialog. Knowing this is essential to estimate the actual state of the GUI application, 
   even if the dialogs appear or disappear with animations. With the methods @CountDialogs(), 
   @GetDialogAtIndex(), @GetIndexOfDialog() you can simply evaluate and traverse 
   the stack of dialog components existing actually in context of 'this' GUI component. 
   With the method @FindCurrentDialog() you can search in 'this' component and all 
   subordinated dialog components for the dialog which is the current one. The both 
   methods @FindDialogByClass() and @FindActiveDialogByClass() are convenient to 
   search in 'this' component and all subordinated dialog components for the dialog, 
   which is an instance of a specified component class. */

/* The method CursorHitTest() is invoked automatically in order to determine whether 
   the view is interested in the receipt of cursor events or not. This method will 
   be invoked immediately after the user has tapped the visible area of the view. 
   If the view is not interested in the cursor event, the framework repeats this 
   procedure for the next behind view until a willing view has been found or all 
   views are evaluated.
   In the implementation of the method the view can evaluate the passed aArea parameter. 
   It determines the place where the user has tapped the view with his fingertip 
   expressed in the coordinates of the views @Owner. The method can test e.g. whether 
   the tapped area does intersect any touchable areas within the view, etc. The 
   affected finger is identified in the parameter aFinger. The first finger (or 
   the first mouse device button) has the number 0.
   The parameter aStrikeCount determines how many times the same area has been tapped 
   in series. This is useful to detect series of multiple touches, e.g. in case 
   of the double click, aStrikeCount == 2.
   The parameter aDedicatedView, if it is not 'null', restricts the event to be 
   handled by this view only. If aDedicatedView == null, no special restriction 
   exists.
   The parameter aStartView, if it is not 'null', restricts the event to be handled 
   by the specified view or another view lying behind it. In other words, views 
   found in front of aStartView are not taken in account during the hit-test operation.
   This method is also invoked if during an existing grab cycle the current target 
   view has decided to resign and deflect the cursor events to another view. This 
   is usually the case after the user has performed a gesture the current target 
   view is not interested to process. Thereupon, the system looks for another view 
   willing to take over the cursor event processing after the performed gesture. 
   Which gesture has caused the operation, is specified in the parameter aRetargetReason.
   If the view is willing to process the event, the method should create, initialize 
   and return a new Core::CursorHit object. This object identify the willing view. 
   Otherwise the method should return 'null'.
   CursorHitTest() is invoked automatically by the framework, so you never should 
   need to invoke it directly. This method is predetermined for the hit-test only. 
   The proper processing of events should take place in the @HandleEvent() method

   the switches to activate within the view state. The second aClearState determines 
   all switches to disable.
   Depending on the state alteration the method will perform different operations, 
   e.g. in response to the clearing of the visible state, the method will request 
   a screen redraw to make disappear the view from the screen.

   With the parameter aOverlayTransition you determine an optional animation to 
   apply on the just presented component when a further dialog component is presented 
   overlying it (by using the method @PresentDialog()). In this way you can control, 
   whether and how the component should disappear when a new component is presented 
   above it. With the parameter aRestoreTransition you specify the opposite animation 
   to perform when after dismissing the overlaying component, the component in the 
   background becomes active again.
   Usually, when presenting a new component by using the method SwitchToDialog(), 
   the previously presented component disappears with the dismiss transition specified 
   at its own presentation time (see the parameter aDismissTransition). This behavior 
   can be overridden by specifying in the parameter aOverrideDismissTransition other 
   animation to hide the old component.
   Switching the dialog in foreground may affect the visibility state of the dialog 
   component lying further in the background. In particular, the component in the 
   background will schedule a restore transition as expected to be after the dialog 
   in foreground is dismissed, and an overlay transition as resulting from the just 
   presented new dialog component. Which transitions are performed results primarily 
   from the parameters aOverlayTransition and aRestoreTransition specified at the 
   presentation time of the background dialog component and the parameter aOverrideRestoreTransition 
   specified at the presentation time of the overlaying (just dismissed) dialog 
   component. Furthermore, you can override this behavior by specifying other animations 
   in the parameters aOverrideOverlayTransition and aOverrideRestoreTransition in 
   the invocation of the method SwitchToDialog().
   The both parameters aComplete and aCancel can be provided with references to 
   slot methods, which are signaled as soon as the present operation is finished 
   (aComplete) or it has been canceled (aCancel) due to other transition being scheduled 
   for the same GUI component aDialogGroup making the actual operation obsolete.
   The present operation is enqueued, so calling SwitchToDialog(), @PresentDialog() 
   and @DismissDialog() several times in sequence for different components in context 
   of 'this' owner component causes the resulting transitions to be executed strictly 
   one after another. This behavior can be changed by passing the value 'true' in 
   the parameter aCombine. In this case, the new operation will be executed together 
   with last prepared but not yet started operation. In this manner several independent 
   transitions can run simultaneously. */

/* The method PresentDialog() schedules an operation to show in context of 'this' 
   component another component passed in the parameter aDialogGroup. The operation 
   to show the component is performed with an animation specified in the parameter 
   aPresentTransition. If the parameter aPresentTransition is 'null', the show operation 
   uses the default transition presenting the new dialog component instantly in 
   the center of 'this' component without performing any smooth animation effects. 
   Calling the method PresentDialog() causes the new dialog component to be pushed 
   on top of an internal stack containing all dialogs existing at the moment in 
   context of 'this' owner component. The dialog component on top of the stack is 
   considered as the active dialog - the dialog, the user may interact with. Other 
   dialogs lying in the background are automatically deactivated and they are suppressed 
   from being able to receive and process user inputs. If not needed anymore, the 
   dialog component can be hidden again by calling the method @DismissDialog() or 
   @SwitchToDialog(), which causes the corresponding dialog stack entry to be removed 
   or replaced. Accordingly, if there was already an active dialog component presented 
   in context of 'this' owner, this old component looses its active state and it 
   is overlaid by the new component.
   With the parameter aDismissTransition you can specify the animation to perform 
   when the just presented dialog component is dismissed again, which is caused 
   when calling the method @DismissDialog() or @SwitchToDialog(). If the parameter 
   aDismissTransition is 'null', the dialog will disappear with the same transition 
   as used to show it (resulting from the parameter aPresentTransition).
   With the parameter aOverlayTransition you determine an optional animation to 
   apply on the just presented component when a further dialog component is presented 
   overlying it. In this way you can control, whether and how the component should 
   disappear when a new component is presented above it. With the parameter aRestoreTransition 
   you specify the opposite animation to perform when after dismissing the overlaying 
   component, the component in the background becomes active again. When calling 
   PresentDialog(), you can override these originally specified transitions to overlay 
   and restore the component in the background. With the parameter aOverrideOverlayTransition 
   you can specify the animation to hide the component in the background instead 
   of using the animation specified at its own presentation time. Similarly, with 
   the parameter aOverrideRestoreTransition you can specify another animation to 
   use when the component in the background restores its active state again.
